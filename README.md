## Part 1: Account Setup
In here we will create accounts all the prerequisite software necessary to work.
1. [Create Github Account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-create-github-account?view=vs-2022)
   * What is Git? Git is essential for software development, offering a version control system that tracks changes and allows for easy reversion to previous states. It allows seamless collaboration among developers by providing each one with a complete history and files of the project, stored in a decentralized repository thanks to black magic.
2. [Create Unity Account](https://support.unity.com/hc/en-us/articles/208626336-How-do-I-create-a-Unity-ID-account)
   * What is Unity? Unity is a well-known game engine that can make 2D, 3D, and VR games.
   * Obtain a License: A default personal license should be sufficient. However, consider getting a student license if you are qualified.
     * Learn more about eligibility and benefits of the [Unity Student Plan](https://unity.com/products/unity-student)
You can continue with a personal license while waiting for approval.
   
## Part 2: Install and Setup Software
Explain what we doing here
1. Install Unity
   1. [Install Unity hub](https://unity.com/download)
      * Unity Hub is your one stop shop which houses your installations of the Unity Engine. Which allows you to change your version of Unity depending on the projct version you are working on.
      * Note: While the engine can be downloaded without hubs, this isn’t recommended. If you still want to download the engine by itself you can learn more at: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManualActivationGuide.html
   3. Install a Unity Version
      1. In the Unity Hub, go to the “Installs” tab on the left. Click “Install Editor” option.
         PUT IMAGE
      2. Choose a version depending on projects and features, LTS (Long Time Support) versions are recommended for stability.
           1. Install the version corresponding to the project you are in. Everyone within the same project should use the same version of the Unity Engine.
                * Note that sometimes the required version of the specific project might not be shown in the pop-up menu on your Unity Hub. In that case, you may need to click the “download archive” option under the “Archive” tab. This will lead you to find the right versions you need.
           3. If you are choosing your own version of the Unity Engine for the project, it is recommended to choose an LTS version.
                * Funny Note:  follow the rule of Three F. If it has a 3 in the second digit and an f. For example: 2022.3.xxfx. These versions will also have tags to indicate they are LTS versions.
      3. In the Add Modules pop-up page (These are additive things you can attach to Unity, which allows you to have new languages, Vr, or other stuff)
           1. Build support: Add any platform build supports based on your operating system & your audience's operating system. For example:
                * If you are making computer games that will function on Windows and Mac systems, you check the boxes for Windows Build Support and Mac Build Support (select both IL2CPP and Mono variants unless only one option is present on your platform).
           2. Language: The default Language for Unity Editor will be English. If you need additional language options, you can add whatever Language Packs that you are more comfortable working with.
           3. Documentation: This is highly recommended as it aids you in navigating through the Unity Editor and scripting C#.
           4. Visual Studio Community: Visual Studio Community Edition is recommended for code editing IDE.
                1. If you choose Visual Studio to be your default script editor yet it is not integrated correctly, visit this site for more instructions: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VisualStudioIntegration.html
                2. When you install Visual Studio, you want to have Tools for Unity Visual Studio Extension, check the box in the “Workloads” tab when installing
                   PUT IAMGE


            

2. Install Git
   * [Install Git Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
       *This is more beginner-friendly as it provides you with an intuitive interface on how to use Git features if you are not familiar with writing commands manually.
   * [Install Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Alternatively you can do this
3. Install Visual Studio
   REST THIS STUFF IS OTHER SHIZ
   * [Install Git Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
       *This is more beginner-friendly as it provides you with an intuitive interface on how to use Git features if you are not familiar with writing commands manually.
   * [Install Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Alternatively you can do this
